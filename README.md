#### lab-1

Consider we have text - a sequence of words, separated by nature language separators (spaces, newlines, commas, semicolons, etc.). We have to find **all** unique pairs of words with maximal edit distance.
For this task, edit distance is determined as count of positions where letters are different, e.g. Distance(b**o**se, b**a**se**ball**) = 5.
